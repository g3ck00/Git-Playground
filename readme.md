This is a test repository used for myself to specifically apply concepts learned from git and GitHub basics tutorials.

Inside the repo is a very basic calculator program written in JavaScript, using the browser as interpreter (index.html). There will be new features/updates and it will be added using Git Bash --- from now on this is the branch for official updates.
